# TOP-ADMM: A Three-Operator ADMM for Wireless Communications and Machine Learning

## In the spirit to support reproducible research, we have shared MATLAB scripts for the two machine learning examples - see details in S. Kant et al., "TOP-ADMM: A Three-Operator ADMM for Wireless Communications and Machine Learning," under review, 2020.

### Example 1: Distributed Sparse Logistic Regression - main script name: consensus_L1_logistic/run__distr_l1_logreg_example.m 

### Example 2: Non-Linear Support Vector Machine - main script name: kernelSVM/run__kernel_svm_example.m
